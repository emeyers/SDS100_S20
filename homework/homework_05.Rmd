## Part 1: Calculating confidence intervals using the bootstrap in R


In the first set of exercises you will calculate confidence intervals for the mean price that Hondas were sold on [Edmunds.com](http://edmunds.com). As mentioned in homework 2, Edmunds has made this data available for education purposes only, so please do not distribute this data. 



$\\$



**Exercise 1.1 (6 points)**:  Let's start by looking at the price of Hondas that were sold on Edmunds.com. The code below loads the data on the prices of cars and extracts a sample of prices that different Hondas were sold for. Calculate the size of the sample and store the answer in an object called `n_sample_size`. Also calculate the mean price that Hondas were sold for and store the result in an object called `the_stat`. Report the value for the sample size and the mean price Hondas were sold for and use the appropriate symbol. Finally, plot a histogram of the car prices and don't forget to label your axes!


```{r honda_hist, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}

# load the car price data
load("cars_small.Rda")

# extract a sample of Honda prices
price_sample <- subset(car_data$price, car_data$brand == "Honda")


# get the sample size and store it in an object called n_sample_size



# get the mean price and store it in an object called the_stat 



# plot a histogram of the Honda prices




```



**Answer**: 







$\\$




    
**Exercise 1.2 (11 points)**: Now use the `do_it()` function to create a bootstrap distribution by doing the following steps:

1. Sample with replacement `n_sample_size` car prices from the `price_sample` vector. 
2. Calculate the mean of the bootstrap sample. 
3. Repeat this process 10,000 times and store the results in a vector called `bootstrap_dist`.


Plot a histogram of the bootstrap distribution, calculate the bootstrap standard error ($SE*$), and print the bootstrap standard error. Finally, calculate a 95% confidence interval using the formula:  $CI_b = \bar{x} \pm  2 \cdot SE*$ and report what the interval is below. 


```{r honda_boot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}









```



**Answer**: 







$\\$









**Exercise 1.3 (4 points)**  If you were to create a confidence interval for the price of Hyundais using the bootstrap method on the Edmunds data, you would get a 95% confidence interval of [\$19,505 \$19,778]  (you can verify this yourself by replacing the line above that gets the car prices to `price_sample <- subset(car_data$price, car_data$brand == "Hyundai"`)).  Based on the confidence interval you calculated for Hondas above, and the confidence interval for Hyundais I just gave you, is it likely that the population mean price for Hondas ($\mu_{honda}$) is the same as the population mean price for Hyundais ($\mu_{hyundai}$)?  Why or why not? 


**Answer**:

## Part 2: Hypothesis tests



To gain a better understanding of hypothesis tests, please answer the following questions which are based on questions from the Lock5 textbook. 



$\\$




**Exercise 2.1 (9 points)**:  **Guilty Verdicts in Court Cases** A reporter on cnn.com stated in July 2010 that 95% of all court cases that go to trial result in a guilty verdict. To test the accuracy of this claim, we collected a random sample of 2000 court cases that went to trial and recorded the proportion that resulted in a guilty verdict. 

a)	What is/are the relevant parameters(s)? What sample statistic(s) is/are used to conduct the test? 

b)	State the null and alternative hypotheses in words and using symbols. 

c)	We can assess the evidence by considering how likely our sample results would be if $H_0$ was true. What does that mean in this case? 



**Answers**:

a) 


b) 


c) 







$\\$








**Exercise 2.2 (6 points)**: Suppose we wanted to test whether the average body temperature of beavers was greater than 37.6 degrees Celsius.  Please state what the population parameter of interest is, and state the null and alternative hypotheses using both words and symbols. 
  


**Answers**: 







$\\$





**Exercise 2.3 (9 points)**: Figure 4.15 shows a null distribution for testing $H_0: \pi = 0.3$ vs $H_a: \pi < 0.3$. In each case, use the distribution to decide which value is closer to the p-value for the observed sample proportion. 

a)	The p-value for $\hat{p}$ = 0.25 is closest to: 0.001 or 0.30?
b)	The p-value for $\hat{p}$ = 0.15 is closest to: 0.04 or 0.40? 
c)	The p-value for $\hat{p}$ = 0.35 is closest to: 0.30 or 0.70?

**Exercise 2.4 (10 points)**: **Dogs and Owners**  To investigate whether dogs resemble their owners, Roy and Christenfeld conducted a study testing people's ability to pair a dog with its owner. Pictures were taken of 25 owners and their purebred dogs, selected at random from dog parks. Study participants were shown a picture of an owner together with pictures of two dogs (the owner’s dog and another random dog from the study) and asked to choose which dog most resembled the owner. Of the 25 owners, 16 were paired with the correct dog. 

To examine whether it is likely that one would get 16 out of 25 owner-dog pairs matched correctly by chance, a null distribution was created by simulating 10,000 times the number of correct dog-owner matches that would occur by chance out of 25 guesses. The results are shown in the table below. 



  | correct matches |  4 |  5 | 6  |  7  |  8  |  9  |  10 |  11  |  12  |  
  |-----------------|----|----|----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------|------|      
  | frequency       | 1  | 17 | 54 | 148 | 341 | 599 | 972 | 1302 | 1549 |
  
  
  
  | correct matches |  13  |  14  |  15 |  16 |  17 |  18 | 19 | 20 | 21 |   
  |-----------------|------|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|----|----|----|       
  | frequency       | 1551 | 1334 | 997 | 612 | 322 | 142 | 51 | 14 | 4  |
  
  


We are testing $H_0: \pi = 0.5$ vs. $H_a: \pi > 0.5$ (evidence of dog-owner resemblance). Please answer the following questions: 

a)	Use the data in the table to verify that the p-value for the observed statistic of 16 correct matches is 0.1145

b)	Use the data to calculate a p-value for an observed statistic of 20 correct matches. 

c)	Use the data to calculate a p-value for an observed statistic of 14 correct matches.

d)	Which of the three p-values in parts a) to c) gives the strongest evidence against $H_0$?

e)	If any of the p-values in parts a) to c) indicate statistical significance, which ones would it be? 





**Answers**:




a) 

b) 

c) 

d) 

e)

## Part 3: Running your own hypothesis tests in R





![Paul](Paul_The_Octopus.jpg)





For the final set of exercises we will examine the soccer prediction record of Paul the Octopus to try to determine if he is psychic. To test Paul's psychic abilities, before each soccer game, two containers of food (mussels) were lowered into the octopus’ tank. The containers were identical, except for country flags of the opposing teams, one on each container. Whichever container Paul opened was deemed his predicted winner. In the 2010 World Cup, Paul (in a German aquarium) became famous for correctly predicting 11 out of 13 soccer games. We will use hypothesis testing to determine the probability that Paul would get 11 out of 13 correct if he was merely guessing.   





$\\$





**Exercise 3.1 (4 points)**: Start by writing down the 5 steps for hypothesis testing. You can look at the lecture slides if you need to, although you should memorize these steps sometime soon.


**Answer**

1) 

2) 

3) 

4) 

5) 





$\\$







**Exercise 3.2 (5 points)**: Now state the null and alternative hypotheses both in words and in the appropriate symbols.







$\\$









**Exercise 3.3 (5 points)**: Compute the statistic of interest and save it in the variable `paul_stat`. Do you think this statistic is likely to be obtained if Paul was guessing? 


```{r paul_stat, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
  
  
  
  
  
    
```


**Answer**: 







$\\$







**Exercise 3.4 (8 points)**: Now use the `do_it()` and `rflip_count()` function to generate a null distribution that would occur if Paul was guessing, and save the results in a variable called `null_distribution`, and plot the null distribution. 


```{r paul_null, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    

    
    
        
```







$\\$







**Exercise 3.5 (5 points)**: Next use the objects `null_distribution` and `paul_stat` along with the `pnull()` function to calculate the p-value, which is the proportion of our 10,000 simulations in which we got 11 or more "heads" (i.e., the proportion of simulations in which we got as many or more "heads" than the number of predictions Paul correctly made). Does this p-value provide evidence that Paul is psychic? 


```{r paul_pval, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    
   


```

**Answer**: 





$\\$






**Exercise 3.6 (5 points)**: Make a judgement call as to whether you believe Paul is psychic based on the p-value and any other information you think is releveant. Make sure to justify your answer to explain Paul's prediction abilities.  




**Answer**: 







$\\$








**Exercise 3.7 (10 points)**: Calculate the confidence interval for Paul's prediction abilities using the bootstrap method.

```{r paul_CI, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, tidy=TRUE}
    

  # a vector of Paul's answers whether they were correct or incorrect 
  #     (not necessarily in the order of his predictions)
  pauls_answers <- c(rep('correct', 11), 'incorrect', 'incorrect')   # 11 correct, 2 incorrect 
    

  # continue creating the bootstrap distribution from here 
  



  
   
```
